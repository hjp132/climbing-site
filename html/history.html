                        of Grenoble, France. Under orders from his king, he used the techniques developed for sieging
                        castles to attain an otherwise unreachable summit. The ascent is described by François Rabelais
                        in his Quart Livre.</li>

                        “modern era”. It took another century before history documents the use of devices similar to
                        today’s fixed anchors: pitons, bolts and rappel slings.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>By the 19th century, climbing was developing as a recreational pastime. Equipment in the early
                        19th century began with an alpenstock (a large walking stick with a metal tip), a primitive form
                        of three-point instep crampon, and a woodcutter's axe. These were the tools of the alpine
                        shepherd, who was shortly to move from guiding sheep to guiding men, a much more lucrative
                        enterprise. With time the alpenstock and the axe were combined into one tool: the ice-axe. Add a
                        large, thick (and weak) rope, to help the client climb, and guide and novice were off to the
                        mountains</li>
                    <li>1848 : Sebastian Abratzky, a local chimney sweep, enters Königstein Fortress by climbing
                        one of
                        the chimneys in the sandstone faces of the plateau to avoid paying an entrance fee. This is now
                        considered historically the first free climb in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and still a
                        climbing route known as Abratzkykamin (IV (ca 5.4)).</li>
                    <li>1864 : Gustav Tröger, Ernst Fischer, J. Wähnert und H. Frenzel, members of the local gymnastics
                        association in Bad Schandau, climb the Falkenstein with artificial aid like ladders after
                        several failed attempts. This is nowadays considered the start of rock climbing as a sport in
                        the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The Turnerweg (III (ca 5.3)) remains the easiest route to the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>1869 : John Muir, famed naturalist and climber, wearing hiking boots, makes the first ascent of
                        Cathedral Peak in Tuolumne Meadows as an on-sight, free solo.</li>
                    <li>1874 : Otto Ewald Ufer and H. Frick make the first ascent of Mönch. This is the first free
                        ascent of a climbing rock in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains without artificial aid for sport.</li>
                    <li>1875 : Half Dome in Yosemite National Park was climbed by George Anderson. He used eye bolts in
                        drilled holes as hand and toe holds. He used a fixed rope to return to his high point each day.
                    </li>
                    <li>1876 : Donald McDonald a crofter from The Isle of Lewis climbs the great stack of Handa after
                        rowing across. This is thought to be the first recorded climb for leisure in the country.[11]
                        The feat was recreated by modern climbers in the show The First Great Climb for BBC2, which
                        showed the difficulty of such a task.[12] This could also be considered the start of the Sport
                        of Rock Climbing.</li>
                    <li>1880s : The Sport of Rock Climbing begins in the Lake District, Peak District and Wales in Great
                        Britain, Saxony near Dresden, and the Dolomites. W. P. Haskett Smith is frequently called the
                        Father of Rock Climbing in the British Isles, and Oskar Schuster was an early climber in the
                        Elbe Sandstone Mountains.</li>
                    <li>1886 : W. P. Haskett Smith makes the first ascent (in free solo style) of the 70 foot Napes
                        Needle, in the Lake District of England. The resulting publicity introduces the general British
                        public to the new sport of rock climbing.</li>
                    <li>1887 : Georg Winkler, at the age of 17, makes the first ascent - solo - of Die Vajolettürme in
                        the Dolomites, initiating the sport of rock climbing in that area.</li>
                    <li>1892 : Oscar Eckenstein, a British climber and early bouldering advocate, conducts a bouldering
                        competition, with cash prizes, among the natives while on an expedition to the Karakoram
                        Mountains.</li>
                    <li>1893 : Devils Tower is first summited by ranchers William Rogers and Willard Ripley through the
                        use of wooden spike pounded into a crack and then connected with a rope. After 6 weeks they
                        summited on the Fourth of July.</li>
                    <li>1897 : O. G. Jones leads Kern Knotts Crack VS 4b (ca 5.8) on the Great Gable in England</li>
