            <h2>Alex Honnold: Climate Change</h2>
            <p
                href='https://www.climbing.com/news/alex-honnold-climate-change-is-urgent-we-need-to-decrease-extraction-now/'>
                (Source:
                climbing.com)</p>
            <p>You can't just walk up to El Capitan and free solo it.</p>
            <p>Like any big ambition, you have to build up to it over time by progressively expanding both your
                capabilities and your comfort zone. Something that seems impossible must be broken down into smaller,
                more manageable pieces until you can find an appropriate way forward.</p>
            <p>My dream to free solo El Cap, to climb it by myself with no ropes, began as just that—a dream. I spent
                something like six years imagining the climb and secretly hoping that it would magically happen. But it
                felt
                too big and too daunting. After years of waiting and wishing, I realized that the climb was going to
                require
                real action on my part. There was no way it would happen unless I put in the time and effort.<br><br>

                I see a real parallel to climate change. It’s the apex issue facing our generation—an issue that feels
                too
                big and too complex to act on. It’s all encompassing, impacting almost every other environmental issue
                that
                we currently face. And it’s incredibly urgent, with most scientists agreeing that as a global community
                we
                only have until 2030 to make meaningful changes before the worst effects of warming are permanently
                baked
                into our future.<br><br>

                The scope of the problem is frightening, and the sense of dread that accompanies it can easily lead to
                apathy. That’s why I spent six years thinking about soloing El Cap, but not doing it—it seemed entirely
                too
                scary to act. But that lack of action didn’t serve me. Ultimately, I had to overcome my fear and start
                making concrete steps towards my goal.<br><br>

                That’s where we stand with climate right now. We have to overcome our apathy and start acting—a task
                that’s
                made more difficult by the well-funded and well-organized industries actively trying to discourage any
                action. In fact, corporate interests have essentially privatized the profits of fossil fuel extraction
                while
                socializing the cost of pollution. These barriers can make it feel as though change isn’t possible on
                the
                individual level.<br><br>

                When COVID hit earlier this spring, I went down a rabbit hole researching environmentalism and climate
                change with an emphasis on personal versus societal action. There are lots of obvious things that we as
                a
                society should be doing, like transitioning away from fossil fuels. (Fun fact, more solar energy strikes
                the
                earth in a single hour than all of humanity uses in a year—a clear sign that our current model of
                drilling
                for oil, shipping it around the world to be refined, shipping it again to be consumed, burning it for
                fuel,
                and then starting the process over makes no sense compared to harnessing the energy we’re already
                swimming
                in.) But not many of us are able to personally invest in utility scale solar projects, which leaves the
                more
                interesting question: what should we as individuals be doing?<br><br>

                We’ve heard some answers before—travel less, eat less meat, have fewer kids, and vote. And while those
                are
                important—they can each drastically lower our personal impact on the earth—they can also be seen as big
                changes or sacrifices. Yet the simple truth is we can all take individual action to help the planet, but
                if
                we fail to address fossil fuel extraction meeting Paris targets then staying below 2 degrees centigrade
                temperature is impossible. Articles in Nature, and studies by Climate Interactive all point to what Bill
                McKibben from 350.org has said, “We have to keep 80 percent of the fossil-fuel reserves that we know
                about
                underground. If we don’t—if we dig up the coal and oil and gas and burn them—we will overwhelm the
                planet’s
                physical systems, heating the Earth far past the red lines drawn by scientists and governments. It’s not
                'we
                should do this,' or 'we’d be wise to do this.' Instead it’s simpler: 'We have to do this.'"<br><br>

                So how do we decrease extraction? One less obvious but exceptionally powerful answer is to change your
                bank.
                When you put your money in a bank it doesn’t just sit there—the bank loans up to 90% of its capital to
                other
                projects. Since the Paris agreement in 2016, major global banks have increased financing of fossil fuel
                extraction to the tune of $1.9 trillion dollars. Six of the top ten institutions supporting increased
                fossil
                fuel extraction are US based: JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi Group, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs
                and
                Morgan Stanley. The simplest way to reduce energy extraction from the arctic, tar sands, and via
                fracking
                and coal is to decrease the funding to these dirty technologies. Being deliberate and choosing a
                sustainable
                bank is key.<br><br>

                It’s ironic that most people’s money winds up being used for all kinds of projects that they personally
                would never support. An individual can go vegan, compost, and turn their thermostat down only to find
                that
                the money in their savings account is funding a pipeline or fracking. The solution is to educate
                yourself on
                your bank’s values and actions. Choose a local credit union or larger bank with more progressive
                environmental policies. Check out the company they keep, especially support for environmental groups.
                But
                most importantly, act on the information you find, and make sure that your bank aligns with your values.
                After all, your bank is using your money to impact the world, one way or another.<br><br>

                As a climber I like to look for the simplest and most elegant solutions to difficult sections of a
                climb. On
                El Cap I spent two years rehearsing movements and memorizing sequences. That might sound like a lot of
                effort but my life depended upon perfect execution of the climb. Putting in a little effort to get
                things
                right didn’t seem so bad. Climate change doesn’t feel as immediately pressing as hanging onto the side
                of a
                cliff with no rope, which is why we have been dragging our feet for so long. But make no mistake, it
                will
                have just as great an impact on hundreds of millions of humans around the world. If we’ve learned one
                thing
                from COVID it’s that we’re capable of remarkable change when given a pressing enough reason to act. It’s
                time to start treating climate change with the urgency it demands and take personal action to make a
                difference.<br><br>

                as documented in the Oscar winning film Free Solo.<br><br></p>

            <p>Boulder, Colorado, USA — October 9, 2020 — Pocket Outdoor Media (POM), the world's leading creator of
                active lifestyle content, today announced the acquisition of Big Stone Publishing (BSP), the longtime
                publisher of Rock & Ice, Trail Runner, and Gym Climber magazines and websites.</p>

                closely aligned on quality and authenticity being central to our mission, and the combination of our
                teams will be a classic case of one plus one equaling three. It’ll be an editorial and sales powerhouse

            <h2>COVID-19 Is Crushing Our Climbing Areas</h2>
            <p href='https://www.climbing.com/news/how-covid-19-is-crushing-our-climbing-areas/'>
                (Source:
                climbing.com)</p>
            <p>Right now, crags and boulder fields around the country are seeing a record number of visitors—with some
                locations reporting up to a 300% increase—and our climbing areas are buckling under the pressure. We’re
                getting disturbing reports from our Conservation Teams and local advocates, who are seeing rampant
                impacts, including overcrowding, trash piling up, eroded trails, crushed and dying plant life, and more
                human waste.<br><br>

                When it comes to surviving the pandemic with our spirits intact, climbers (and other people who enjoy
                outdoor recreation) have a leg up. One consistent message we’re hearing from health-care professionals
                is that we’re safer outside, in the open air. With a few extra precautions, we’re still able to get out
                and enjoy the sport we love and feel some semblance of normal.<br><br>

                But we aren’t alone. The pandemic has created a huge rush of people heading outdoors to recreate. With
                the majority of climbing gyms still operating at limited capacity, we are spending more time outside,
                and our crags are feeling the crunch. We are also sharing these spaces with a lot more people who are
                camping, hiking, biking, and paddling—which means more cars, more trash, and more crowds.<br><br></p>

                Most climbing areas simply don’t have the recreation infrastructure—like formal trails, toilets, ample
                parking, etc.—to handle so many visitors without serious impacts to the environment," says Access Fund
                Stewardship Director, Ty Tyler. "Now, as the pandemic has pushed even more people into the outdoors,
                we’ve reached a critical tipping point."<br><br>

                <b>It's Time to Ramp Up<br><br></b>
                Access Fund is working quickly to ramp up our stewardship and outdoor education initiatives to:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Send more resources to help our Conservation Teams and local climbing organizations restore damage
                    at
                    our crags.<br></li>
                <li>Help transition indoor climbers into responsible outdoor stewards.</li>
                <li>Foster continued minimum-impact knowledge in seasoned climbers.</li>
                <li>Welcome all climbers to the crags, while stressing our responsibility to take care of the places we
                    love.</li>
                <li>But we need your help. As climbers, we have an opportunity to be leaders within the outdoor
                    community,
                    setting an example for how to recreate responsibly.</li>
            </ul>
