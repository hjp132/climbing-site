                <h4>Bouldering</h4>
                <p>Trad Climbing is normally performed outside, using gear that the climber has brought with them. This
                    means you would need to be well equiped to start & finish a climb and have to install all of the
                    gear whilst lead climbing the rock. The ethic of 'leave no trace' was really pioneered by Yvon
                    Chouinard and Royal Robbins.
                    <br><br>
                    Trad Climbing historically is one of the earlier forms of climbing, this is mainly due to the fact
                    not many people were climbing at this point so there wasn't any form of permanently installed bolts
                    for climbers to clip to.
